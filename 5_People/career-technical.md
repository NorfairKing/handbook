# Technical Career

You start as a coder, working on small, well defined and isolated tasks. Then you immediately need to become an engineer that gets loosely defined problems/features and creates solutions for them. You need to do this because we are not a development agency and most of our work does not come from some outside specification, but from problems we and our customers discover day-to-day. 

The top two positions are two branches of the technical career:
* Lead Software Engineer careers means you start taking over managerial tasks and leading people.
* Principal Software Engineer means you take ownership of all of technical nitty-gritty details in the company.
